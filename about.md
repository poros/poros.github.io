#### If you're looking for the computer guy
Writing code and tinkering with computers for a living, writing code and tinkering with computers for fun.

Still uncertain whether he's a Software Engineer, a Systems Engineer or a Software Reliability Engineer, keeps telling people he's one of the computer guys at Yelp. Mainly interested in distributed systems and stream processing, has a taste for open-source software.

Having accidentally stumbled upon a couple of degrees and diplomas in Computer Engineering between Italy and France, tries to keep his boring past locked up on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/antonioverardi).

Raised as a fervent C programmer, got fascinated by the zen of Python and then converted without much resistance long time ago. Learned a couple of those cool shaolin tricks since then, but still practicing the [import antigravity](https://xkcd.com/353/) thing without much success. Recently developed a teenage crush on Rust, just waiting for it to pass on its own.

#### If you are just looking for the guy in the picture
Mainly writing code and poetry. Even actual words from time to time.

Regularly dumping some of them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/porosVII) or [Facebook](http://facebook.com/antonio.uccio.verardi). Very rarely [publishing](http://poros.github.io/works/) or [blogging](http://poros.github.io/pseudoblog/) them.

Primarily interested in literature in all its forms, from essays on postmodernism to Disney comics or graffiti on public toilets doors. And in philosophy, video games and game design, too. But also in physics, math, psychology, riddles, cinema and art in general (yeah, even classic). Oh, and obviously in nice food.

Considers his most precious and useless skill the ability of pleasantly discussing about literally anything with anyone, especially if blessed by utter ignorance of the matter. Always up for a live demo.
